Based
in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, TOKAI Holdings Corporation <3167> engages
in two main businesses, energy and home services, primarily the provision of
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in canisters, and information and
telecommunications services. Aiming to become a “Total Life Concierge”(TLC), a
company offering a complete range of services for everyday life, TOKAI Holdings
just completed the first fiscal year of its three-year medium-term management
plan, called Innovation Plan 2016 “Growing”. This plan targets consolidated net
sales of ¥209.5bn and operating profit of ¥12.6bn for its final year, the fiscal
year through March 2017, i.e., FY3/17. In
FY3/15, the company’s consolidated net sales edged down by 0.8% year-on-year
(y-o-y) to ¥187,511mn, but its operating profit grew 21.8% to ¥9,003mn, the
first rise in three years. Profit growth was led by the gas and oil business,
the information and telecommunications services business, and the water
business, and the number of customers increased by 19,000 to 2,537,000 at the
end of FY3/15. The company’s financial position continued to improve in FY3/15,
as the balance of its interest-bearing debt fell faster than the company had
projected. For
FY3/16, the company projects a 2.5% y-o-y upturn in consolidated net sales to
¥192.2bn, but a 13.8% decline in operating profit to ¥7.76bn. The company
foresees an operating profit drop because it plans to increase its selling
expenses by ¥3.0bn y-o-y to promote sales of its broadband communications
services through fiber-optic cables in collaboration with telecommunications
carriers and mass retailers of electronic goods. Nonetheless, the company
forecasts a y-o-y drop in this cost in FY3/17, leading to a consolidated
operating profit of ¥12.7bn for FY3/17, slightly higher than its original
target. On May 27, 2015, the company announced that it and Tokyo
Electric Power Co., Ltd. <9501> were considering tying up to enter the
Japanese market for electricity retailing. By providing electricity, the
company hopes to expand its line of life infrastructure services and increase
the number of its customers. The company is also preparing to introduce a menu
of bundled services for its 2,537,000 customers, a strategy by which it plans
to lift the proportion of customers that subscribe to many services, now only
7%, and increase the sales per subscriber.◆Business Trends Net profit hit a record high
in FY3/15, surpassing the last high of FY3/13 (1) FY3/15 results In
FY3/15, consolidated net sales decreased by 0.8% y-o-y to ¥187,511mn, but
operating profit rose 21.8% to ¥9,003mn, recurring profit increased 21.9% to
¥8,549mn, and net profit jumped 51.4% to ¥3,934mn. Net sales were slightly
lower than the company had planned, but profits were higher than planned. Net
profit reached a record high, eclipsing the previous high of FY3/13. Profit improvement was led by the oil and gas business, the
information and telecommunications services business, and the water business.
The operating profit margin rose 0.9ppt y-o-y, reflecting a decline in the cost
of sales ratio, a modest increase in selling costs, and a drop in SG&A
expenses due to improved productivity in indirect administration. The company’s
effective tax rate fell to 47.8% in FY3/15 from 56.4% in FY3/14, lifting net
profit substantially.At the end of FY3/15, TOKAI Holdings served 2,537,000 customers,
which was 19,000 more than it served at the end of FY3/14. The numbers of
customers for the LPG business, the cable TV broadcasting business and the
security business declined slightly, but the numbers for broadband services,
the cable TV telecommunications service, and the water service increased. In
December 2012, the company launched its TLC Membership Service to build
customer loyalty and increase the proportion of multi-service contracts with
customers. At the end of FY3/15, this service had 396,000 members, which was
90,000 more than it had a year earlier.Gas and oil business lifted
profit by rationalizing indirect support and improving administrative
efficiency (2) Business segment results FY3/15
performances by business segment are explained below. ○Gas
and Oil Business In
the gas and oil business, net sales fell 4.3% y-o-y to ¥93.1bn in FY3/15, but
operating profit grew by ¥1.2bn to ¥7.7bn. The sales decline was due mainly to
two factors in the company’s mainstay LPG business: 1) the number of customers
for the business dropped by 3,000 to 572,000, and the business lowered its
sales price to reflect a decrease in its raw material cost. Of the ¥1.2bn improvement in segment operating profit, about
¥1.1bn resulted from a drop in SG&A expenses stemming from the
rationalization of indirect support and an increase in administrative
efficiency.○Information and Telecommunications Services Business In
the information and telecommunications services business, net sales increased
by 3.4% y-o-y to ¥40.1bn and operating profit grew by ¥500mn to ¥5.0bn. A 6,000
increase in the number of customers for broadband services lifted operating
profit by ¥300mn, customer acquisition costs were cut by ¥100mn, and an
increase in sales of telecommunications services to companies raised operating
profit by ¥200mn. As part of its broadband services, in FY3/15, the company began
selling the @ TCOM Hikari service and the TNC Hikari service in collaboration
with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), which provides the fiber-optic
cables for these services. With an expansion of the Japanese market for cloud
computing, corporate demand for the company’s high-speed communications
services and data centers increased, supporting the growth of its corporate
telecommunications services.○Cable TV Business In the cable TV business, net sales rose 0.7% y-o-y in FY3/15 to
¥24.4bn, but operating profit edged down by ¥100mn to ¥1.7bn. The number of
customers for the cable TV broadcasting service fell by 9,000 in FY3/15 because
the service stopped the rebroadcasting of programs to areas not served by
digital TV broadcasting from Tokyo. However, the number of customers for cable
TV telecommunications services increased by 5,000, sustaining a slight increase
in overall net sales in the business. Operating profit declined in the cable TV
business primarily because the business increased its costs by ¥100mn to
prevent the loss of customers for the broadcasting service.○Water Business In the water business, sales grew 13.3% y-o-y to ¥5.0bn, and the
operating loss suffered by this business shrank by ¥700mn to ¥1.3bn. The number
of customers for this business increased by 7,000 to 130,000, reflecting sales
promotions in the Greater Osaka area and other parts of Japan, as well as in
the business’s main markets of Shizuoka Prefecture and the Greater Tokyo
region. The increase in the number of customers reduced the operating loss by
¥300mn, and the business cut its costs of customer acquisition, advertising and
sales promotion by ¥500mn.○Construction and Real Estate Business In the construction and real estate business, net sales
increased by 4.0% y-o-y to ¥20.0bn, but operating profit decreased by ¥400mn to
¥1.0bn. The business sold all 12 units of a new condominium building in
Shizuoka City, and the company merged its housing renovation business in
Greater Tokyo into its construction and real estate business. These factors
supported overall sales growth. In general, however, the demand for
construction and real estate weakened in FY3/15 in reaction to rush demand in
FY3/14 before Japan’s consumption tax was raised to 8% from 5%. This downturn
in demand was the main factor causing the operating profit decline.○Other Businesses, Adjustments In
other businesses, after adjustments for all businesses, sales dropped 3.0%
y-o-y to ¥5.0bn, and the operating loss expanded by ¥300mn to ¥5.0bn. In the nursing care business, the company opened three new
facilities in Shizuoka Prefecture, including day care facilities and nursing
homes offering day care, bringing the total of such facilities to seven. The
number of users of these facilities increased, supporting a rise in sales in
this business, but the cost increase required to build the new facilities led
to a drop in profit. In the wedding ceremony business, sales continued to
decline y-o-y in FY3/15, reflecting a drop in the number of weddings.
Therefore, the company closed one of its three wedding halls in Shizuoka Prefecture
at the end of FY3/15.Targets for interest-bearing
debt and equity ratio achieved one year ahead of schedule (3) Financial position At
the end of FY3/15, total assets came to ¥165.7bn, which was ¥7.9bn less than
the total at the end of FY3/14. Sales receivable decreased by ¥2.0bn,
inventories dropped by ¥1.5bn, and goodwill fell by ¥2.0bn. Total liabilities
at the end of FY3/15 were ¥122.2bn, down ¥13.1bn y-o-y, due mainly to a ¥12.7bn
drop in interest-bearing debt. Net assets increased by ¥5.1bn during FY3/15 to
¥43.5bn, due to additional retained earnings and valuation gains on other
securities holdings. Interest-bearing debt fell more in FY3/15 than the company had
planned for. In its current three-year management plan, the company had targeted
¥74.1bn of interest-bearing debt for the end of FY3/16, but at the end of
FY3/15, this debt stood at ¥73.1bn. Similarly, the company’s equity ratio rose
to 25.7% at the end of FY3/15, whereas the company had targeted an equity ratio
of 25.1% for the end of FY3/16. 報告內容僅供參考，不得作為任何投資引用之唯一依據，且其投資風險及決定應由投資人自行判斷並自負損益。
