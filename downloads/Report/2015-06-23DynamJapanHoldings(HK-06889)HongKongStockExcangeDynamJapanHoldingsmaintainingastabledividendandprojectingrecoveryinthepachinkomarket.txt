Dynam Japan Holdings Co., Ltd.’s (Hong Kong Stock Exchange: 06889) ball rental fee income was
\826,072 mn (HKD53,261 mn), decreased by 10.4% YoY, according to financial
results for the year ended March 2015. Operating revenue decreased by 6.8% to
\154,556 mn (about HKD9,965 mn), profit before income tax by 43.6% to \19,518
mn (about HKD1,258 mn) and net profit by 46.8% YoY to \11,303 mn (about HKD729
mn). As of March 31, 2015, the
company operated 393 pachinko halls, up from 375 one year earlier, and earnings
per share were \15.2 (about HKD1). An important management policy is to
continue to pay stable dividends to shareholders. The Board of Directors passed
a resolution designating the year-end dividend payment at \7 per share (for an
annual dividend of \14). Net profit decreased by 46.8%, but the dividend was not lowered.
This is because Dynam Japan Holdings has confidence in market conditions going
forward. In addition to projecting a recovery in the pachinko industry from the
latter half of FY3/16, Dynam Japan Holdings has already refurbished 40 pachinko
halls with high playing-cost machines and increased payout ratios. Furthermore,
the company has plans to renovate a further 80 halls during the first half of
FY3/16 to try to retain customers. 報告內容僅供參考，不得作為任何投資引用之唯一依據，且其投資風險及決定應由投資人自行判斷並自負損益。
