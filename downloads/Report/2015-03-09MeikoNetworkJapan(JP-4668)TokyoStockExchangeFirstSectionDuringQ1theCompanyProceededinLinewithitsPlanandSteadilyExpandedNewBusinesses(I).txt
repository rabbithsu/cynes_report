On January 14, 2015, Meiko
Network Japan Co., Ltd. announced its consolidated results for the first
quarter of the fiscal year through August 2015, i.e., Q1 FY8/15. Overall the
company proceeded in line with its plan. Consolidated net sales rose 16.9% year
on year (YOY) to \3,876mn, while ordinary income fell 28.6% YOY to \457mn.
Moreover, from FY8/15, the company consolidated MAXIS Education Inc., the
largest franchisee in its Meiko Gijuku business, with a resulting increase in
net sales of approximately \600mn, and a decline in ordinary income of \90mn
including amortization of goodwill. The number of students at
Meiko Gijuku cram schools as of November 30, 2014 was down 0.5% YOY to 144,092
as growth continued to falter. However, the company has implemented “Meiko-style! Self-supported Learning” as a differentiation strategy, and at this stage is making
steady progress on creating an appropriate structure for reigniting growth,
including internal organizational reforms and the establishment of the Meiko
Support Center. Although these efforts will not produce immediate effects, the
number of students is expected to begin gradually increasing in from H2 FY8/15
onwards. Meanwhile, the new businesses
of Waseda Academy Kobetsu Schools, Meiko Soccer Schools, and Meiko Kids Schools
have all been expanding steadily. Currently the company is proceeding with
upfront investments for increasing the number of schools, and these are
expected to need a little more time to begin contributing to profits; however,
these investments worth noting, because they will expand the future business
base. In particular, with increasing demand for child care Meiko Kids Schools
plans to open three new schools in spring of 2015, expanding its total to six,
and intends to continue expanding actively going forward. In Meiko Network Japan’s full-year consolidated forecasts for FY8/15, net sales are
expected to increase 24.8% YOY to \19,420mn and ordinary income to rise 2.3% to
\3,620mn, for the first profit increase in three years. Although the education
services industry is expected to become increasingly fierce competitive environment
due to the declining birth rate, as a result of initiatives to expand the
number of students, the company expects number of students enrolled to recover
from H2 FY8/15. The company is planning to increase the number of schools by
around 60 compared with the end of FY8/14. The company has an active stance on returning profits to
shareholders. For FY8/15, the company plans to raise its dividend per share by
\2 to \34 (dividend payout ratio 41.5%), and plans to raise its dividend payout
ratio to around 50% eventually. The company also introduced a shareholder
reward program in FY8/12, under which each shareholder of 100 shares or more as
of the end of August receives a \3,000 QUO card as a gift. Based on the company’s closing share price on January 23, 2015, of \1,217, the total
yield to holders of a minimum unit of shares (100 shares) is in the 5% level,
significantly higher than the average dividend yield for listed Japanese
companies of approximately 1.7%.◆Description of Businesses Direct and franchised operation of private tutorial
schools, “Meiko Gijuku Schools” Meiko Network Japan’s main business is Meiko Gijuku Schools. Some of these schools
are operated directly, but most are franchised. Meiko Gijuku is the leading
brand of private tutorial schools in Japan. Through a subsidiary, Tokyo Ishin
Gakuin (Tokyo Medical School Preparatory Institute), Meiko Network Japan also
operates a preparatory school business specializing in preparation for medical
university. In addition, the company engages in various other education-related
businesses. Its other businesses outside of tutorial and supplemental
education, Meiko Network Japan operates Meiko Soccer Schools, which teach basic
soccer skills to children, Waseda Academy Kobetsu Schools, which provide tutorial
instruction to junior high school and high school students seeking entry into
prestigious high schools and universities, Meiko Kids Schools, which provide
nursery care for preschool children and after-school care for elementary school
children, and Abrakadoodle Art Studios, which teach art to preschool and
elementary school children. The company’s subsidiary Youdec Co. publishes a magazine featuring
information about the content of entrance examinations for junior high schools
and high schools, produces model examination questions, sells educational
materials to students of private schools, and offers private instruction to
students at their schools. In addition, Youdec’s subsidiary, Koyo Shobo Co., is involved in the academic
publishing business.In September 2014, Meiko
Network Japan acquired MAXIS Education, the largest franchisee in the Meiko
Gijuku business, as a subsidiary. In October, the company acquired Waseda EDU
Japanese Language School, which operates Japanese language schools for overseas
students, as a subsidiary. Waseda EDU Japanese Language School’s net sales for FY4/14 appear to have had a minimal effect on
the company’s overall performance, being only small
at \171mn. As detailed in the bar chart below, in FY8/14 the Meiko Gijuku
business supplied the majority of Meiko Network Japan’s total consolidated sales and profits. The company’s policy described in its medium-term strategy calls for
extending the growth of the Meiko Gijuku business while developing other
educational businesses.◆Business Trends The company made progress as planned during Q1, the
conversion of MAXIS into a subsidiary bringing a double-digit increase in
sales. (1) Business Trends in Q1
FY8/15 (September to November 2014) On January 14, 2015, the
company announced its consolidated operating results for Q1 FY8/15 (September
to November 2014). Consolidated net sales rose 16.9% YOY to \3,876mn, and
operating income declined by 45.8% to \331mn. From Q1 FY8/15, the company
acquired MAXIS Education (“MAXIS”) as a subsidiary, which boosted net sales by approximately
\600mn, while decreasing operating income by approximately ¥90mn (including amortization of goodwill of ¥35mn). Moreover the All-Japan Meiko Gijuku Conference, which has
been held in December every year, was brought forward to November causing a ¥50mn increase in expenses. Ordinary income declined by 28.6% YOY to ¥457mn, mainly reflecting an improvement in investment income and
loss from equity-method affiliates and the recording of gain on valuation of
investment securities. Net income declined 7.7% to ¥353mn, mainly reflecting the recording of surrender value of
insurance under extraordinary income. Overall the company appears to have
proceeded in line with its plan for Q1 FY8/15.In the mainstay Meiko Gijuku business (including franchised
schools), the number of schools at the end of November 2014 had risen steadily
by 19 YOY to 2,131 schools. However, the results were affected by a decline in
the number of students by 0.5% to 144,092, and a decline in sales at Meiko
Gijuku schools by 2.4% YOY to ¥11,173mn. The competition in
the private tutorial schools against the backdrop of declining birth rate is a
factor in the decline. However, the company has taken steps to reignite growth,
including implementing “Meiko-style! Self-supported
Learning” as a differentiation strategy, and at
this stage is also strengthening initiatives including internal organizational
reforms and the establishment of the Meiko Support Center, use of the Internet,
and the development of new services.○Meiko Gijuku directly
operated business Sales in the Meiko Gijuku
directly operated business segment increased by 45.0% YOY to \2,080mn, and
segment income decreased by 77.0% YOY to \32mn. As mentioned above, the
acquisition of MAXIS as a subsidiary increased sales by around \600mn, and
decreased segment income by about ¥90mn
(including ¥35mn for amortization of goodwill).
Excluding this impact, sales increased 2.7% YOY to \1,473mn and segment
operating income declined 9.6% to \126mn. Factors decreasing profit include an
increase in head office expenses for improving service quality (such as
personnel expenses involved with the establishment of the Support Center).
Furthermore, MAXIS recorded a loss for its first quarter; however this is due
to seasonal factors and performance has proceeded as planned. The number of schools at the end of November 2014 had increased
by 100 from the end of FY8/14 (including 89 schools under MAXIS) to 310
schools, and the number of students had increased by 7,477 to 25,300 (including
7,235 students at MAXIS). Excluding those of MAXIS, the number of students
increased by 1.4% YOY, and sales per student continued to climb for a second
consecutive quarter.○Meiko Gijuku FC
business Sales in the Meiko Gijuku FC
business segment declined 8.2% YOY to ¥1,329mn,
while segment income declined 12.4% to ¥671mn. The decline in sales at franchised schools and in the
number of new school openings were factors slump in earnings, while as
mentioned above, the Japan Meiko Gijuku conference was brought forward to
November, decreasing income by \50mn. Furthermore, the impact of acquiring
MAXIS as a subsidiary decreased sales by ¥93mn (offset and elimination of royalties and sales from MAXIS,
and so forth). The number of schools in the franchised schools business
declined by 81 from the end of FY8/14 to 1,821 school while the number of
students declined by 8,204 to 118,792, mainly due to the discounting of schools
directly operated by MAXIS. Adding back the portion of MAXIS (comparing by the
same standard used in the previous year) the number of students declined by
0.5% YOY, and sales per student continued to decline slightly.○Preparatory school
business Sales in the preparatory school business operated by Tokyo Ishin
Gakuin (Tokyo Medical School Preparatory Institute) decreased by 7.1% YOY to
\131mn, while segment income decreased by 65.6% YOY to \6mn. The number of
students declined by 5 YOY to 147, with the low level causing the decline in
sales and income. The company has strengthened its efforts to acquire new
students in spring 2015, such as conducting consultation sessions for entry
into medical universities with the cooperation of private medical universities
and proprietary general model examinations.○Other businesses Sales for other businesses
increased by 14.6% YOY to ¥335mn, and segment loss
increased to ¥51mn (compared to a loss of ¥25mn in Q1 FY8/14). Although sales continued an increasing trend
with the growth in student numbers, the segment continues to operate below
breakeven point due to continuing upfront investments such as for opening more
schools. Breaking down the results by
operation, sales from Meiko Soccer Schools were ¥30mn, (¥31mn in Q1 FY8/14) and
operating loss was \4mn (¥6mn in Q1 FY8/14). The number
of directly operated schools increased by 2 YOY to 15 schools, and a total of
17 schools including two franchised schools. Moreover, the total number of
students at directly operated and franchised schools and was 973, an increase
of 48 from Q1 FY8/14, the highest level to date. Sales from Waseda Academy Kobetsu Schools were ¥80mn (¥55mn in Q1 FY8/14) and
operating loss was ¥12mn (operating profit of ¥0.7mn in Q1 FY8/14). The slight loss despite an increase in
sales was due to operating system expenses that had been included in corporate
expenses until FY8/14 being attributed to business segment expenses from
FY8/15. Excluding this factor, the segment saw a slight increase in income. In
the number of schools, the number of directly operated schools was 6 (including
2 schools of MAXIS) and the number of franchised schools was 12, for an
increase of 1 school from the end of FY8/14 under the directly operated/
franchised category, while the number of Waseda Academy Kobetsu Schools was 7,
for an increase of 3 schools. The number of students expanded steadily,
increasing by 197 from the end of FY8/14 to 1,743 students.Meiko Kids Schools opened two
schools in spring of 2014, bringing the number of schools to 3. The number of
students (regular students only) expanded from 65 in Q1 FY8/15 to 175 students.
The company plans to open a further three schools in the spring of 2015 as
increased demand for after-school care for children has created strong demand
for places in the schools. In terms of profits, the company has not disclosed
any information, partly because the business is still in the upfront investment
stage. In other operations,
consolidated subsidiary Youdec Co. saw an increase in both sales and income,
with sales of ¥175mn and operating income of \8mn due to
solid sales of model entrance examination questions and private instruction to
students at their schools. Moreover, Koyo Shobo Q1 sales and income lacked
vigor since sales for its mainstay university educational materials are
concentrated between February and April. In October, the company acquired Waseda EDU a subsidiary,
however since the deemed date of acquisition is November 30 Waseda EDU’s results will not be reflected until the Q2 onwards.Current ratio declined as cash and deposits decreased,
but shareholders’ equity ratio maintained
above 70% (2) Financial status and
management indicators In the Company’s financial status as of the end of November 2014, total assets
were \16,779mn, up \210mn from the end of FY8/14. The main increases and
decreases were due to the acquisitions of MAXIS and Waseda EDU, which caused
cash and deposits to decline by \2,162mn while goodwill increased by \1,994mn.
In addition, the company’s assets and so forth also
increased with the addition of these new subsidiaries. Liabilities stood at ¥3,700mn, up \323mn from the end of FY8/14. Net assets were ¥13,078mn, down ¥112mn, mainly due to a
decrease in retained earnings following the payment of dividends. Turning to management indicators, although the current ratio
declined following a decrease in cash deposits, the equity ratio stayed above
70% and since the company is managed virtually without debt, we consider that
it has continued to maintain a good financial status. 報告內容僅供參考，不得作為任何投資引用之唯一依據，且其投資風險及決定應由投資人自行判斷並自負損益。
