◆Results Trends Both precision springs and plastics performed well last
term, significant improvement in financial health (1) FY3/15 results ○ Income Statement – Precision spring business performs well Net
sales in FY3/15 were ¥29,487mn (+8.8% y-o-y), with operating income of ¥1,081mn
(+31.8% y-o-y), ordinary income ¥992mn (+21.0% y-o-y), and net income of ¥535mn
(-21.6% y-o-y). Precision springs net sales were ¥17,628mn, an increase of
12.7% y-o-y, representing 59.8% overall. With double-digit growth, core
automotive (products) were overall drivers, and products for medical devices in
the UK increased significantly. Operating income from precision springs was
¥769mn, a 58.9% increase y-o-y. The operating income margin rose 1.1 percentage
points y-o-y to 4.4%. On the other hand, net sales in the plastics business
were confined to a 3.4% y-o-y rise to ¥11,859mn. Operating income from this
business was ¥305mn, declining 8.4% y-o-y, with its operating income margin
declining 0.3 percentage points y-o-y to 2.6%. Demand for audio visual
equipment in Malaysia declined, with profitability also deteriorating. The reason that the ordinary income growth rate was lower than
the rate of increase in operating income was deterioration in results at a 28%
held subsidiary. The net loss in equity of affiliates rose ¥163mn y-o-y to
¥239mn, being recorded in non-operating income. Given that the subsidiary has
now been valued at zero, from FY3/16 a similar loss should not be incurred. Net
income declined. While gains of ¥147mn from the sale of Daiichi Kasei Holdings
shares were recorded in extraordinary income, mudslides occurred at the
Fukushima Factory site due to localized torrential rains, with the estimated
amount for repair work of ¥105mn being reserved under extraordinary losses.
Further, because there was a partial sale of Daiichi Kasei Holdings shares,
minority interests of ¥159mn arose, which was also a factor increasing the
reduction in net income. Given that the remaining shares in Daiichi Kasei
Holdings were transferred at term-end, while in FY3/16 net sales and operating
income from the plastics business will disappear, in return minority interests
will not arise.Operating income was ¥261mn. Apart from yen depreciation, the
major factors tending to increase earnings included increased revenue from the
spring businesses in Asia and the UK (¥1,231mn), and an increase in marginal
profit due to a reduction in costs in the spring businesses in China and other
countries (¥326mn). On the other hand, in addition to the negative impact of
yen depreciation, factors that tended to lower earnings (totaling ¥1,296mn)
included increased staff costs domestically and in the UK, and increased fixed
costs associated with the acquisition of Funabashi Electronics.○ Balance sheet – significant improvement in the shareholders’
equity ratio As
a result of the shares in Daiichi Kasei Holdings being transferred at the end
of the term, the business activities of the plastics business were reflected in
the income statement; however, they are excluded from the term-end balance
sheet. In FY3/15 total assets were ¥16,554mn, down ¥3,686mn y-o-y. Given that
shareholders’ equity rose ¥2,274mn y-o-y to ¥7,002mn, the shareholders’ equity
ratio rose significantly from 23.4% in the previous term to 42.3%. As
interest-bearing liabilities declined ¥3,080mn y-o-y to ¥3,977mn, financial
safety improved, with the D/E (interest-bearing liabilities/shareholders’
equity) ratio falling below 1x to 0.57x. ROE, which is one of the main indicators of corporate
performance, declined from 15.5% in the previous term to 9.1%. ROE may be
divided into profitability (net income margin, net income/net sales), asset
utilization efficiency (total asset turnover, net sales/total assets), and
borrowed capital usage (the inverse of the shareholders’ equity ratio,
financial leverage = total assets/shareholders’ equity). A decline in net
income against revenue means a decline in profitability, and a decline in
financial leverage counters any improvement in asset utilization efficiency.○ Cashflow status The balance of cash and cash equivalents at term end in FY3/15
rose by ¥662mn y-o-y to ¥3,407mn. Cashflow from operating activities rose
¥304mn y-o-y to ¥2,139mn as a result of increased profits and increases in
depreciation expenses. Cashflow from investment activities was ¥1,179mn, with
increases in the amount of capital expenditure at the company and its UK
subsidiary, the negative cashflow increasing by ¥134mn. Cashflow from financial
activities was ¥794mn due to repayment of interest-bearing liabilities, the
negative cashflow increasing by ¥248mn.Lower revenues and operating income this period, only
precision springs performing well (2) FY3/16 forecast – with
only the precision spring business double-digit revenue & earnings growth
expected In FY3/16 revenues of ¥19,800mn (down 32.9% y-o-y) and operating
income of ¥880mn (down 18.6% y-o-y) are expected. Lower revenue and earnings
will result from the sell-off of the portion of the plastics business. Net
sales and profits this term shall be limited to the precision spring business.
In that business an increase of 12.3% in revenues and 14.4% in operating income
is expected compared to levels in the previous term.◆Shareholder Returns Increasing dividends, aiming for a 30% payout ratio Due
to deterioration in results, dividends were suspended from FY3/08; however, in
FY3/13 dividends were resumed. Subsequently, dividends have been repeatedly
raised in line with results, with FY3/16 expected to return to the same level
as prior to the suspension of dividends. In
FY3/16 it is planned that the dividend per share will be raised ¥0.5
year-on-year to ¥3.5. If the company implements as planned a 10 for 1 reverse
stock split of its ordinary shares in October 2015, the EPS shall be ¥132.84
and the full-year dividend per share ¥35. The forecast payout ratio will be an
unchanged 26.3%. Under the Mid-term Management Plan currently in force, the
target payout ratio is set at 30%. In May 2015 the company effected a buyback of 500,000 of its own
shares (with a total amount of ¥91mn). The total return to shareholders from
the combined forecast dividend and share buyback is 43.0%. Further, it will
introduce a new shareholder incentive program. It plans to distribute QUO
cards, targeting shareholders of record as of end-September 2015. 報告內容僅供參考，不得作為任何投資引用之唯一依據，且其投資風險及決定應由投資人自行判斷並自負損益。
