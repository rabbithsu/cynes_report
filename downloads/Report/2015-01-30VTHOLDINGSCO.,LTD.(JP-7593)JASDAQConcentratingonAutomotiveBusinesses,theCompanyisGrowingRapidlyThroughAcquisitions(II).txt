◆Business Trends Decline in Profits Due to Stagnation in High
Profitability Businesses, Despite Contribution of New Subsidiaries to Higher
Sales (1) 1H FY3/15 Results ○Earnings Status In VT Holdings’ consolidated results for 1H FY3/15, net sales grew 3.7% YoY to
\62,670mn, operating income decreased 29.8% YoY to \2,840mn, ordinary income
declined 26.8% YoY to \2,888mn, and net income was down 3.9% YoY to \2,076mn.Although net sales increased
YoY, the increased included the contribution of about \2,800mn from new
subsidiaries due to M&As. On a same-store basis, net sales were slightly
lower YoY. The gross profit margin deteriorated to 19.5% from 21.3% in 1H
FY3/14, mainly because of a decrease in the gross margin in the used car sales
business due to the impact of deterioration in the domestic used car market and
lackluster performance in the highly profitable automotive services business.
On the other hand, SG&A expenses were up 6.0% YoY to \9,351mn, partly
because of the increase in new subsidiaries, while the SG&A ratio to net
sales increased to 14.9% from 14.6% in 1H FY3/14, and operating income dropped
sharply YoY. Earnings at the company’s main businesses were as follows.On August 1, 2014, the company
made MG HOME <8891> a consolidated subsidiary. MG HOME is a consolidated
subsidiary listed on the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is
engaged in the planning and marketing of condominiums for sale. MG HOME
contributed about \1,200mn to net sales in 1H FY3/15, but seems not to have
contributed much to profits. On April 1, 2014, the company
made Nissan Satio Nara, a Nissan dealership, into a consolidated subsidiary.
This subsidiary is also expected to record annual net sales of around \3,000mn,
however it is not expected to contribute much to profits.(New Car Sales) In 1H FY3/15, Japan’s new car market declined to 97.2% YoY under the impact of the consumption
tax rate increase. In this environment, the number of new car sales for the
Group declined by 6.0% YoY to 12,786 units. Honda new car sales were up 3.6% to
3,398 units, but Nissan new car sales fell further than expected, declining by
14.9% YoY to 7,531 units. However, from April 2014, the Group added Nissan
Satio Nara as a new consolidated subsidiary, lifting sales in the new car sales
business by 1.2% YoY or \27,165mn and gross profit by 0.5% to \4,224mn. The
gross profit margin was 15.6%, down from 15.7% for 1H FY3/14.(Used Car Sales) Overall, the used car market
in Japan for 1H FY3/15 saw domestic sales decline 6.4% YoY, despite an increase
in the number of units exported. In this environment, the company’s used car sales increased 1.9% YoY to 23,306 units, while sales
in the used car sales business were up 6.5% YoY to \18,283mn. However, due to
an overall decline in profitability due to tougher competition and other
factors, gross profit deteriorated by 20.4% YoY to \2,007mn and the gross
profit margin declined to 11.0%, down from 14.7% for 1H 3/14.(Automotive Services) Sales for 1H 3/15 in the
automotive services business were down 0.8% YoY to \12,479mn and gross profit
was down 5.0% YoY to \4,550mn, with the gross profit margin at 36.5%, down from
37.9% in 1H FY3/14. The number of passenger cars in Japan has remained stable,
but the decline in sales was driven by a sharp fall in the overall number of
vehicles due for statutory inspection, since this year coincided with the
second statutory inspection for vehicles purchased immediately after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the first statutory inspection period for
vehicles purchased immediately after the Great East Japan Earthquake, both
times when sales had declined. (Rent-A-Car Business) Supported by the opening of
new offices, the rent-a-car business increased its sales by 0.1% YoY to
\2,645mn in 1H FY3/15, while gross profit fell 4.9% YoY to \1,098mn, and the
gross profit margin edged down to 41.5% from 43.7% in 1H FY3/14. (Housing and Other Business) The housing and other business
increased its sales in 1H FY3/15 by 84.0% YoY to \2,097mn, partly because MG
HOME changed from an equity-method affiliate to a consolidated subsidiary from
June 2014. However, since the profit contribution of MG HOME is still small,
gross profit increased only 54.2% YoY to \310mn, while the gross profit margin
sank to 14.8% from 17.1% in 1H FY3/14. ○Financial condition The company’s financial condition at the end of 1H FY3/15 was as summarized
on the table below. Current assets were up \425mn from the end of FY3/14 to
32,067mn. The main factors in the change included the addition of MG HOME to
the scope of consolidation, a decline of \3,605mn in cash and deposits, and an
increase of \3,278mn in inventories. Non-current assets were up \4,128mn at
\54,822mn, mainly reflecting an increase of \3,473mn in property, plant and
equipment due to increases in buildings and structures for new store openings. Meanwhile, current liabilities
climbed \237mn from the end of FY3/14 to \37,973mn, mainly due to an increase
of \8,343mn in short-term loans payable and a decline of \6,257mn in notes and
accounts payable-trade. Non-current liabilities rose \2,516mn to \18,161mn,
primarily reflecting an increase of \1,847mn in long-term loans payable and an
increase of \695mn in other non-current liabilities. Meanwhile, net assets
increased by \1,799mn from the end of FY 3/14 to \30,754mn. This mainly
reflected an increase of \1,248mn in retained earnings due to the posting of
net income. As a result, the equity ratio stood at 33.6% as of the end of 1H
FY3/15, down 0.3 of a percentage point from the end of FY3/14.○Cash flow A summary cash flow statement
for 1H FY3/15 is shown below. Operating activities used net cash of \6,273mn,
with the main sources of cash being income before income taxes and minority
interests of \3,343mn and depreciation of \1,655mn, while the main uses of cash
were an increase in inventories of \1,153mn and a decrease in notes and
accounts payable-trade of \6,558mn. Investing activities used net cash of
\2,904mn, mainly due to payments of \3,386mn for the purchase of property,
plant and equipment. Financing activities provided net cash of \5,569mn, which
was primarily due to a net increase of short-term loans payable amounting to
\6,302mn and proceeds from long-term loans payable of \3,467mn. As a result of the above, cash
and cash equivalents declined \3,610mn to finish at \3,992mn at the end of 1H
FY3/15.For FY3/15 Higher Sales Projected but Lower Profits amid
A Challenging Industry Environment (2) Company Forecasts for
FY3/15 The company’s full-year forecast for FY3/15 is shown below. The company
projects a 6.3% increase in net sales to \141,000mn, a 20.7% slide in operating
income to \8,000mn, a 20.8% decline in ordinary income to \7,900mn, and a 6.4%
drop in net income to \4,800mn. The initial forecast for profits has been
dramatically revised downward in light of the operating environment and 1H
results. However, the company is taking a very conservative stance on 2H, so
the likelihood of a further downward revision is small.In the new car sales business,
the company is expecting the challenging business environment to continue,
despite the effect of consolidating Nissan Satio Nara, and is projecting a 2.9%
YoY fall in unit sales to 30,506 units, and a 1.5% YoY drop in sales to
\64,551mn. Meanwhile, in the used car sales business, the company is projecting
a 2.2% YoY increase in unit sales to 48,833 units, but a 4.7% increase in sales
to \36,675mn atop an expected recovery in unit prices. For the automotive services
business, the company forecasts strong growth of 5.8% YoY in sales to
\27,767mn. The addition of Nissan Satio Nara is expected to contribute as in
the new car sales business. In the rent-a-car business, new offices are
expected to contribute to a 4.2% YoY increase in sales to \5,779mn. In the
housing and other businesses, the company is projecting a 183.4% YoY increase
in sales to \6,229mn, partly due to the contribution from the consolidated MG
HOME.The company is projecting a
lower profit margin of 19.7%, down from 21.3% in FY3/14, with SG&A expenses
to increase by 8.4% YoY to \19,729mn, partly due to the addition of new
subsidiaries, and a ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales of 14.0%, up from
13.7% in FY3/14. As a result, the operating income ratio is forecast to decline
to 5.7%, down from 7.6% in the previous fiscal year.MG HOME and Satio Nara will
contribute to consolidated net sales after being included in the scope of
consolidation since FY3/15, however they are not expected to make much
contribution in terms of operating income. Furthermore, the company converted
Scotts Motors Artarmon Pty Ltd (SMA) into a subsidiary on October 24, 2014. SMA
operates two Honda dealerships in New South Wales, Australia, and has had only
a minor impact on consolidated results for FY3/15 at this point. In the future,
however, the company aims to introduce VT Holdings’ accumulated expertise in automobile dealership operation to
return to profitability and contribute to consolidated income.Furthermore, on November 25,
2014, the company announced that it would acquire the shares of Griffin Mill
Garages Limited (GMG) and convert it into a subsidiary. GMG operates two
automobile dealerships in the South Wales district of the UK, and deals in five
brands: Nissan, Skoda, Kia, Fiat, and Peugeot. After its conversion to a
subsidiary, as with the abovementioned SMA, GMG will introduce the accumulated
automobile dealership operation expertise of VT Holdings and pursue synergies
with CCR MOTOR CO. LTD., which was also made into a subsidiary in the UK in
April 2012. In the future, GMG aims to contribute to the consolidated earnings
of the Group, but its impact on consolidated earnings for FY3/15 appears to be
only minor. The acquisition price has not been disclosed.◆Medium-term Business Plan Over the medium term, VT Holdings aims to achieve an
ordinary income margin of 8% or more and an equity ratio of 40% or more The group has set forth the
following two medium-term management goals. (1) Ordinary income margin of
8% or more The company has already
achieved an ordinary income margin of 7.5% in FY3/14, and aims to raise it to
8% or more. It continues to hold this target despite the regrettable forecast
of declining decline to 5.7% in 1H FY3/15. Specifically, the company plans to
improve the profitability of all its businesses, setting as a benchmark the
11.5% ordinary income ratio of its most profitable subsidiary, Nagano Nissan
Auto. It will continue to improve
the profitability of newly acquired subsidiaries, develop synergy between its
used car export business and its other businesses, and establish rent-a-car
offices throughout Japan to reach this objective. (2) Equity ratio of 40% or
more At the end of 1H FY3/15, the
company achieved an equity ratio of 33.6%, surpassing its initial goal of 30%.
Now, it aims for a ratio of 40% or more. The first measure to achieve this is
to raise profitability, as discussed above, thereby increasing the company’s retained earnings and its equity. In addition, the company
will undertake highly efficient M&As, limiting investments to within its
cash flow from operations. Thus, it will simultaneously increase the scale of
its operations and reduce its liabilities.◆Shareholder Return Policy Targeting a dividend payout ratio of 30% or more, the
company is likely to increase its dividend as its profits grow VT Holdings actively strives
to make strong returns to shareholders and to respond to their demands. On
April 1, 2014, it made a 3-for-1 share split to lower its share price, making
its shares affordable for more investors (and expanding the investor base), and
increasing the market liquidity of its shares. At the same time, the company
raised its dividend payout ratio target to 30% from 20%, considering factors
such as the scale of its profit growth and the dividend payout ratios of other
listed companies. For FY3/15, the company plans to pay an interim dividend of
\7 per share and a year-end dividend of \7 per share, for a total dividend of
\14 per share. Based on the company’s
EPS forecast for FY3/15, a dividend of \14 per share will yield a dividend
payout ratio of 34.3%. As the company intends to maintain a dividend payout
ratio of 30%, it is likely to raise its dividend accordingly when its profits
begin to grow again. 報告內容僅供參考，不得作為任何投資引用之唯一依據，且其投資風險及決定應由投資人自行判斷並自負損益。
